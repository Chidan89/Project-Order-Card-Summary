# Chidan89 - Order summary card

![Design preview for the Order summary card coding challenge](preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this order-summary-card challenge.

This challenge is to help me improve my basic CSS coding skill by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and basics of CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I use CSS to complete this challange and did not border about making it responsive as that will happen frequently with other challanges going forward.


## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. There's both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. Though i concentrated on the desktop design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that the best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin` are needed.


All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the informations such as color palette and fonts.
